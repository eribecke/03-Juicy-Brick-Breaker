# Project Name

2/25/23

This is my third project for my Game Technology Course. In this project, I have made a "juicy" version of the classic Brick Breaker game.

This Brick Breaker boasts a dark and exciting theme. 
Dispell all of the ancient stone bricks with the help of your one-eyed companion before the timer runs out!


## Implementation

All of the code for this project was implemented using GDScript in Godot (excluding the shader code). 

Features:
- Created my own sprite for the paddle
- Gave the paddle a face
- Animimated the paddle's mouth and pupils so that the mouth would frown the further away the ball would go, and the pupils would follow the ball
- Animated the indicator using tweening, ease in and out
- Added particles to the paddle everytime it gets hit
- Created my own sprite for the particle
- Created my own background for the game
- Added shaders to the Main Menu, Pause Menu, and End Game Menu
- Added two balls to the Main Menu to add more movement
- Created a new theme for the buttons in the Main Menu and Pause Menu
- Used a dynamic font for labels
- Created my own sprite for the ball
- Animated the pupil in the ball so that it would look at the paddle
- Created my own sprites for the bricks
- Created my own music for the game
- Added sound effects for the paddle and ball
- Added a score display at the end of the game

## References
I created my own art for my sprites using Pixilart.com. I drew the game background using Procreate on my IPad. 

I got both of my sound effects off of freesound.org. My Ball_Sound was created by editor_adp (link:https://freesound.org/people/editor_adp/sounds/269482/) and my Paddle_Sound was created by fthgurdy (link: https://freesound.org/people/fthgurdy/sounds/528197/). 

The shader I used was Night Sky 2D from godotshaders.com, created by zuwiwano (link: https://godotshaders.com/shader/night-sky-2d/). 

The font I used was Hanalei Fill, created by Astigmatic on fonts.google.com (link: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hanalei+Fill?preview.text=Play&preview.text_type=custom). 

Lastly, the music for my game was created by myself in MuseScore.

## Future Development

I would like to add more tweening to my game in the future, specifically on the bricks, and add a camera so that I can make the game shake as well. I also would want to add some more levels to the game.
